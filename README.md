# Online-Form-Filling-using-Java-Selenium
Java Selenium Code using chrome driver to fill an online form. Automation is the future Optimization, so I could develop more in this in future using Gmail API, etc.,
When we enter our login credentials, it uses chrome driver and does the form filling.
Actually I have implemented it for my college website, but anyone can do it on any website by seeing my source code. It gives you a basic idea.
